"""Hand-authored supervisor tree — sidecar for :mod:`service.py`.

The :data:`SUPERVISORS` list is the OTP-style hierarchical supervisor
tree (see ~/org/1.org). It is **manually written** — there is no .art
declaration for the supervisor hierarchy (``system.art`` only carries
the FC compositions + the Supervisor/GatewayBridge process forward-decls,
not the restart strategy or the child grouping).

It lives in this separate module so that regenerating ``service.py``
from ``platform/system/system.art`` (the FC list) does NOT clobber the
tree. ``service.py`` re-exports it as ``service.SUPERVISORS`` so existing
consumers (``artheia.manifest.platform``, ``FcLayer``, ``FcSoftware``)
keep working unchanged — edit the tree HERE.

Children name either another :class:`SupervisorNode` or a
:class:`Process` from the rig's execution manifests. ``app_sup`` ships
empty in the platform base — application leaves are added by the rig
layer (e.g. the demo rig Overrides app_sup with demo_p1/p2/p3), each
resolving to a Process with its own ``start_cmd``, exactly like an FC
leaf.

Restart-strategy choices match the OTP design:

- ``root`` is the catastrophic-escalation point. ``one_for_all`` so a
  top-level escalation reboots the entire subtree.
- ``ar_sup`` is ``rest_for_one`` — if ``core_sup`` fails, ``app_sup``
  restarts too (apps can't survive without the platform).
- ``core_sup`` is ``rest_for_one`` — within the platform layer, ``exec``
  precedes the others. If it crashes, downstream peers restart in
  declared order.
- Per-domain sub-supervisors are ``one_for_one`` (peer-independent).
- ``app_sup`` is ``one_for_one`` — vendor apps are independent.
