"""Typed supervision tree, loaded from artheia's emitted ``executor.yaml``.

The supervisor binary on each machine reads this same YAML to decide
its restart strategy and child order. rf-theia reads it to *predict*
what the supervisor should do, then compares against what it actually
does (observed via the supervisor_watcher event stream).

This is the second stable contract with artheia after ``rig.json``:
ONLY this module knows the YAML shape. Generators / restart observers
/ keyword assertions consume the typed tree.

Tree shape (matches deploy/.staging/<machine>/ipk/executor.yaml)::

    root [one_for_all, max=3/5s]
      ar_sup [rest_for_one]
        core_sup [rest_for_one]
          exec, core, crypto, sm                 (workers, declared order)
          network_sup [one_for_one] → nm, com, …
          host_svc_sup [one_for_one] → per, rds
          pltf_sup [one_for_one] → phm, ucm, …
        app_sup [one_for_one] → demo_p1, demo_p2, demo_p3

Strategy semantics encoded:

  one_for_one    children independent — only the crashing child restarts
  rest_for_one   restart crashing child + all children AFTER it in
                 declared order
  one_for_all    restart all children when any one crashes

Each supervisor node has its own restart-limit policy
(max_restarts / max_seconds). When limit is breached the parent
supervisor's strategy kicks in — escalation walks up the tree.
