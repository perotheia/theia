"""Cross-checks between the topology graph (netgraph.json) and the
deployment (rig.json).

Catches the bugs that hide in the gap between "what we said we'd wire"
and "what we said we'd deploy":

  - rig component points at a composition that doesn't exist in the
    netgraph
  - a node receives messages that no deployed sender emits
  - a destination references a node not deployed anywhere
  - an entire node has no signals declared (likely a placeholder)

Each check returns a list of :class:`Issue`. Severity classifies the
finding:

  - ``"error"``: definitely broken — keyword should fail the test
  - ``"warning"``: suspicious — keyword surfaces but doesn't fail by
                    default (test can opt in with ``severity="warning"``)
